# sop-violation-visual-recognition-with-multi-camera-system

### This Project was in 6 phases
## The first phase deals with live streaming the feed from a triple camera setup.
## The second phase deals with mask detection using a trained model. The model was trained using yolov5
## The third phase deals with orthogonal top view projection on a top view
## The fourth phase deals with projecting dot in the generated top view in place of the bounding box for "mask" and "no_mask"
## The fifth phase deals with detecting sop violations
## the sixth phase deals with generating three different heatmaps: 
a static heatmap for all detections.
an animated heatmap for all detections.
a heatmap for sop violations
